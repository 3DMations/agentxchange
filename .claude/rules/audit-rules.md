# Memory Audit Rules

The /project:memory-audit command enforces these rules. Every violation is
reported to the user before any corrective action is taken.

## Structural Rules (auto-fixable with confirmation)
- S1: Every entry in learnings/ MUST have valid YAML frontmatter with ALL
  required fields from TEMPLATE.md (including successful_applications and
  preserved_in_summary). Missing fields -> propose addition with defaults.
- S2: Every entry in learnings/ MUST appear in index.json. Orphans -> propose
  adding to index or archiving.
- S3: index.json MUST NOT reference entries that don't exist on disk.
  Dangling refs -> propose removal from index.
- S4: Every entry MUST have a non-empty title, category, and trigger_context.
  Empty required fields -> flag for user to fill in.
- S5: Entry IDs MUST follow the pattern: learn-YYYY-MMDD-NNN.
  Non-conforming IDs -> propose rename.
- S6: Dates in frontmatter MUST be valid ISO 8601. Invalid dates -> flag.
- S7: index.json stats (total, active, archived) MUST match actual file
  counts on disk. Mismatch -> recalculate from disk and propose correction.

## Content Quality Rules (require user decision)
- Q1: Duplicate detection — entries with Jaccard similarity exceeding
  dedup_jaccard_threshold (from taxonomy.yaml, default 0.6) on title +
  trigger_context + tags are flagged as potential duplicates. Propose merge.
- Q2: Entries with recurrence_count >= 3 but no corresponding line in
  gotchas.md -> propose adding to gotchas.
- Q3: Entries with confidence_score >= 0.9 AND successful_applications >= 4
  AND stats.active >= 400 -> propose archival with summary preservation.
  (Below 400 active entries, do not propose archival — keep everything.)
- Q4: Entries referencing files that no longer exist in the project ->
  flag for relevance review (do NOT auto-archive).
- Q5: Summary files that haven't been regenerated since last sync, AND
  10+ new entries exist since last sync -> flag for regeneration.
- Q6: Analyze entry distribution across categories. If > 70% of entries from
  the last 30 days fall in a single category, suggest adding more granular
  subcategories for that domain in taxonomy.yaml.

## Size & Performance Rules
- P1: Total active entries SHOULD stay under 500. Above 450 -> warn user.
  Above 500 -> new entries blocked until space is freed.
- P2: No single summary file should exceed 80 lines. Longer -> split by
  subcategory or compress low-value items.
- P3: CLAUDE.md total line count MUST stay under 200. If memory system
  additions push it over -> move content to .claude/rules/ files.
- P4: Individual entry files should not exceed 50 lines. Longer entries ->
  flag for compression.

## Security Rules (block and alert)
- X1: NEVER store API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings in
  any memory file. Scan entry content for these patterns:
  [A-Za-z0-9_\-]{64,}            (catch-all for long tokens — 64+ chars)
  sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}            (OpenAI-style keys)
  ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36,}           (GitHub PATs)
  AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}               (AWS access keys)
  xox[bps]-[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+        (Slack tokens)
  password\s*[:=]\s*\S+           (password assignments)
  secret\s*[:=]\s*\S+             (secret assignments)
  Bearer\s+[a-zA-Z0-9\-._~+/]+   (Bearer tokens)
  If found -> REFUSE to write. Alert user.
  NOTE: The 64-char threshold avoids flagging git SHAs (40 chars),
  UUIDs (32-36 chars), and typical base64 hashes (44 chars). Only
  unusually long unbroken alphanumeric strings are caught.
- X2: Entries referencing .env files, ~/.ssh/, ~/.aws/, or ~/.kube/ MUST
  use [REDACTED] placeholders for any values. Store the pattern, not the secret.
- X3: Memory files that would be committed to git MUST NOT contain
  project-internal IP addresses, hostnames, or personally identifiable data
  unless the user explicitly confirms.
